1. Can the post slug be saved? Updated routes, index & show templates

2. no? Testing:
 - DB factories
 i)   Unit tests for a Post( has a creator, has comments, can add a comment )
 ii)  Unit tests for a Comment (has an owner )
 iii) ViewPosts ( view all, view a single post, view comments associated with the post )
 iv)  CreatePost ( an authenticated user can create, guests may not create, validation[requires body, title] )
 v)   ParticipateInBlogPosts ( guests may not participate, authenticated users may participate )
 Etc...

4. Replies

5. Tags ( A tag can be used on multiple posts. When you visit localhost/tag/{tag}, it should lists all posts for that tag.)
Hint: Use a many to many relationship, and learn how to use a pivot table.

6. Forgot password & reset password
    i) A new page with a form for submitting the email. It checks if the user exists and sends a password reset email with a link to reset
    ii) Set the link to expire after a specific time
    iii) The link should be secure such that no one is able to guess

7. Send notifications when a comment or post is added ( Use emails to notify )

8. Add a user subscription form in the homepage. For every user that subscribes, send them an email when a new post is published.
Use Queues for this functionality when sending multiple emails.
