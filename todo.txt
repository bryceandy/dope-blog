2. no? Testing:
 - DB factories
 i)   Unit tests for a Post( has a creator, has comments, can add a comment )
 ii)  Unit tests for a Comment (has an owner )
 iii) ViewPosts ( view all, view a single post, view comments associated with the post )
 iv)  CreatePost ( an authenticated user can create, guests may not create, validation[requires body, title] )
 v)   ParticipateInBlogPosts ( guests may not participate, authenticated users may participate )
 Etc...
